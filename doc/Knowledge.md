### Knowledge in CrewAI is a powerful system that allows AI agents to access and utilize external information sources during their tasks. Think of it as giving your agents a reference library they can consult while working.
Key benefits of using Knowledge:
* Enhance agents with domain-specific information
* Support decisions with real-world data
* Maintain context across conversations
* Ground responses in factual information

⠀[](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#supported-knowledge-sources)Supported Knowledge Sources
### CrewAI supports various types of knowledge sources out of the box:
### Text Sources
* Raw strings
* Text files (.txt)
* PDF documents

⠀
### Structured Data
* CSV files
* Excel spreadsheets
* JSON documents

⠀[](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#quick-start)Quick Start
### Here’s an example using string-based knowledge:
Code


from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, LLM
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# Create a knowledge source
content = "Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."
string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content=content,
)

# Create an LLM with a temperature of 0 to ensure deterministic outputs
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# Create an agent with the knowledge store
agent = Agent(
    role="About User",
    goal="You know everything about the user.",
    backstory="""You are a master at understanding people and their preferences.""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm,
)
task = Task(
    description="Answer the following questions about the user: {question}",
    expected_output="An answer to the question.",
    agent=agent,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    knowledge_sources=[string_source], # Enable knowledge by adding the sources here. You can also add more sources to the sources list.
)

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"question": "What city does John live in and how old is he?"})
# [](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#knowledge-configuration)Knowledge Configuration
# [](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#chunking-configuration)Chunking Configuration
### Control how content is split for processing by setting the chunk size and overlap.
Code


knowledge_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="Long content...",
    chunk_size=4000,     # Characters per chunk (default)
    chunk_overlap=200    # Overlap between chunks (default)
)
# [](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#embedder-configuration)Embedder Configuration
### You can also configure the embedder for the knowledge store. This is useful if you want to use a different embedder for the knowledge store than the one used for the agents.
Code


...
string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="Users name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco.",
)
crew = Crew(
    ...
    knowledge_sources=[string_source],
    embedder={
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {"model": "text-embedding-3-small"},
    },
)
# [](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#clearing-knowledge)Clearing Knowledge
### If you need to clear the knowledge stored in CrewAI, you can use thecrewai reset-memories command with the --knowledge option.
Command


crewai reset-memories --knowledge
### This is useful when you’ve updated your knowledge sources and want to ensure that the agents are using the most recent information.
# [](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#custom-knowledge-sources)Custom Knowledge Sources
### CrewAI allows you to create custom knowledge sources for any type of data by extending theBaseKnowledgeSource class. Let’s create a practical example that fetches and processes space news articles.

## [](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#key-components-explained)Key Components Explained
### 1 Custom Knowledge Source (SpaceNewsKnowledgeSource):
	* Extends BaseKnowledgeSource for integration with CrewAI
	* Configurable API endpoint and article limit
	* Implements three key methods:
		* load_content(): Fetches articles from the API
		* _format_articles(): Structures the articles into readable text
		* add(): Processes and stores the content
### 2 Agent Configuration:
	* Specialized role as a Space News Analyst
	* Uses the knowledge source to access space news
### 3 Task Setup:
	* Takes a user question as input through {user_question}
	* Designed to provide detailed answers based on the knowledge source
### 4 Crew Orchestration:
	* Manages the workflow between agent and task
	* Handles input/output through the kickoff method

⠀This example demonstrates how to:
* Create a custom knowledge source that fetches real-time data
* Process and format external data for AI consumption
* Use the knowledge source to answer specific user questions
* Integrate everything seamlessly with CrewAI’s agent system

⠀[](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/knowledge#about-the-spaceflight-news-api)About the Spaceflight News API
### The example uses the[Spaceflight News API](https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/docs/), which:
* Provides free access to space-related news articles
* Requires no authentication
* Returns structured data about space news
* Supports pagination and filtering

⠀You can customize the API query by modifying the endpoint URL:


# Fetch more articles
recent_news = SpaceNewsKnowledgeSource(
    api_endpoint="https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/articles",
    limit=20,  # Increase the number of articles
)

# Add search parameters
recent_news = SpaceNewsKnowledgeSource(
    api_endpoint="https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/articles?search=NASA", # Search for NASA news
    limit=10,
)
