    Impact: The chosen method will determine how the task is broken down and executed.

    Available Methods:
    a) Least-to-Most Decomposition
    - Purpose: Break complex tasks into manageable pieces
    - Best for: Complex tasks that can be solved incrementally
    - Implementation: Start with simplest subtasks and build up
    - Example: "1. Start with basic... 2. Add complexity... 3. Integrate all..."

    b) Plan-and-Solve Strategy
    - Purpose: Create comprehensive plan before execution
    - Best for: Well-defined problems requiring systematic approach
    - Implementation: Detailed planning phase followed by execution
    - Example: "Plan: 1... 2... 3... Now execute each step..."

    c) Progressive Task Refinement
    - Purpose: Iteratively improve solution quality
    - Best for: Tasks requiring continuous improvement
    - Implementation: Start broad, then refine based on feedback
    - Example: "Initial approach -> Refine based on X -> Further improve with Y"

    d) Dependency-Based Planning
    - Purpose: Organize tasks based on prerequisites
    - Best for: Tasks with clear dependencies
    - Implementation: Map dependencies and sequence accordingly
    - Example: "Must complete A before B, then C can start..."

    e) Hierarchical Task Planning
    - Purpose: Organize tasks in levels of abstraction
    - Best for: Complex tasks with clear hierarchy
    - Implementation: Break down from high-level to detailed steps
    - Example: "Main goal -> Sub-goals -> Specific actions"

    6. Output Format:
    Purpose: Define how the final response should be structured and presented.
    Impact: The chosen format will affect how the information is organized and consumed.

    Available Formats:
    a) JSON
    - Purpose: Structured, machine-readable data
    - Best for: Data that needs to be processed or parsed
    - Structure: Nested key-value pairs

    b) Email
    - Purpose: Professional communication format
    - Best for: Business communications or formal responses
    - Structure: Subject, greeting, body, closing
    - Example: "Subject: ... Dear ..., [Content] Best regards, ..."

    c) Markdown
    - Purpose: Formatted text with hierarchy
    - Best for: Documentation or structured content
    - Structure: Headers, lists, emphasis, links
    - Example: "# Title\n## Subtitle\n- Point 1\n- Point 2"

    d) Text
    - Purpose: Simple, readable plain text
    - Best for: Direct, unformatted responses
    - Structure: Paragraphs and line breaks
    - Example: "Main point. Supporting details. Conclusion."

    e) Other
    - Purpose: Custom format for specific needs
    - Best for: Special requirements not covered by standard formats
    - Structure: As specified by requirements
    - Example: Based on specific needs

    Remember: Your goal is to provide an optimized prompt based on architect direction and user requirements,
    in order to help users to use your prompt in their automated process, not to use UI elements or other tools to solve the user's problem directly.

    Provide the output in JSON format including:
    1. Complete prompt structure (role, task, rules)
    2. Selected methods (reasoning_method, planning_method, output_format) with justification
    3. Explanation of optimization choices
    4. Usage guidelines
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object containing the Role, Task, Rules & Constraints, Reasoning Method, Planning Method, Output Format, Explanation of Optimization Choices, and Usage Guidelines.
